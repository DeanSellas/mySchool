# mySchool

mySchool is an app I am creating for Android, IOS, and Windows phones for my school to show if it is a blue or gold day, what clubs are going on that day, and add your homework to your calendar. Currently it is only for Glenbrook South but I have written my code so it can easily be ported to other schools.

## Current Features

* Shows what day it is (Blue or Gold for Glenbrook South)
* Shows Month and Day of year
* Login to Google Account (for api and homework feature)
* Add your Homework!
* Add Clubs!
* Shows Upcoming Homework and Upcoming Clubs on Home Page

## Planned Features

* ~~Show Clubs for the day~~ (Added in Commit [23402a7](https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool/commit/23402a77b1ffc050bf2955921b1cac38fd90b9d3))
* ~~Add your Homework~~ (Added in Commit [8015ab0](https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool/commit/8015ab0b95a0d84fc21c2b3fff2640c6a340911d))
* ~~Add Notes to Homework~~ (Added in Commit [f9aff59](https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool/commit/f9aff590a7412883cf47d0af1c69a60a5e3376c2))
* Push Notifications for clubs and homework
* Find school by an id (to help with porting to other schools)

## Want this for your school?

Because this is currently open source feel free to fork it and modify it to your liking. But know that I am not responsible for any of these builds and will not offer support to unofficial builds. All I ask if you fork this for your own project is you give me credit in your version of the app.

I am also willing to port it to your school so please do not hesitate to send me an email at contact@thespacecoder.com. So we can discuss this app coming to your school.

## How to Help Develop this App

### Requirements
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Local Web-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server)

you will need both of these in order to help run the app on your computer.

After you install these open command prompt and navigate to the project. After you get to your project type in this line of code.

`ws -p 9000`

This will start a local webserver on port 9000 (if you do not know what this means do no worry about all the details just know it works). Now to actually test the app go to <a href="http://localhost:9000/">localhost:9000</a> on your prefered webbrowser and you will be seeing your current build of the app.

Note that when you save you will have to refresh the page in order for the changes to be processed.

If this does not work please submit a issue and I will assist you as soon as possible.
