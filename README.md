# mySchool

mySchool is an app I am creating for Android, IOS, and Windows phones for my school to show if it is a blue or gold day, what clubs are going on that day, and add your homework to your calendar. Currently it is only for Glenbrook South but I have writen my code so it can easily be ported to other schools.

## Current Features

* Shows what day it is (Blue or Gold)
* Shows Month and Day of year
* Login to Google Account (for api and homework feature that is comming soon)

## Planned Features

* Show Clubs for the day
* Add your Homework
* Push Notifications for clubs and homework
* Find school by an id (to help with porting to other schools)

## Want this for your school?

Because this is currently open source feel free to fork it and modify it to your liking. But know that I am not responsible for any of these builds and will not offer support to unoffical builds. All I ask if you fork this for your own project is you give me credit in your build of this app.

I am also willing to port it to your school so please do not hessitate to send me an email at contact@thespacecoder.com. So we can discuss this app comming to your school.
