# mySchool

mySchool is an app I am creating for Android, IOS, and Windows phones for my school to show if it is a blue or gold day, what clubs are going on that day, and add your homework to your calendar. Currently it is only for Glenbrook South but I have writen my code so it can easily be ported to other schools.

## Current Features

* Shows what day it is (Blue or Gold for Glenbrook South)
* Shows Month and Day of year
* Login to Google Account (for api and homework feature)
* Add your Homework!
* Add a Description to Homework
* Shows Upcomming homework assignments on Home Page and alerts if homework is due that day

## Planned Features

* Show Clubs for the day
* ~~Add your Homework~~ (Added in Commit [8015ab0](https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool/commit/8015ab0b95a0d84fc21c2b3fff2640c6a340911d))
* ~~Add Notes to Homework~~ (Added in Commit [f9aff59](https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool/commit/f9aff590a7412883cf47d0af1c69a60a5e3376c2))
* Push Notifications for clubs and homework
* Find school by an id (to help with porting to other schools)

## Want this for your school?

Because this is currently open source feel free to fork it and modify it to your liking. But know that I am not responsible for any of these builds and will not offer support to unoffical builds. All I ask if you fork this for your own project is you give me credit in your version of the app.

I am also willing to port it to your school so please do not hessitate to send me an email at contact@thespacecoder.com. So we can discuss this app comming to your school.
