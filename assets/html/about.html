    <p>Hello there! First off, I would like to thank you for using our app. Under the help Mr. Mcfadden, Dean and I (Nicholas) are both finishing up our Junior year of Highschool while creating this app. Clearly this app is designed to help students know what day of the block schedule it is as well as helping students stay organized. Knowing our goal, it is to at some point be able to help multiple schools nationwide have an easy and compact way for students know block schedule and organize their homework assignments.</p>
