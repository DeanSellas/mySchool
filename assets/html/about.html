      <h2 class="text-center">Letter From the Developer</h2>
      <p>As of 1/20/17 I will be discontinuing development of mySchool there are many reasons behind this but the main one is I no longer have time to work on this project and I want to move on to bigger and better things so keep your eyes open for future projects. You can keep up to date on my projects on blog.thespacecoder.com, that is where I am going to be posting news and updates to work. I had a lot of fun creating mySchool and I hope it served you well, it will still be hosted on my website and I will be fixing bugs but no new features will be added.

      <h2 class="text-center">About the App</h2>

      <p>Thank you for checking out mySchool. This app was created by me Dean Sellas, with the help of Nick Horvat so that we could have an agenda for all of our classes. This webapp was built using HTML, CSS, Angular JS, Javascript, and the Google Calendar API. I have plans on porting it over to a native iOS and Android app if it becomes popular enough, but at the moment I am focusing on the web build by adding new features and killing bugs (if all that went over your head don't worry it was supposed to).</p>

      <p>Want to help with development? Feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/TheSpaceCoder/mySchool" target="_blank">Github Repository</a> for up to date source code. What is that? Can't code but still want to help out? Well here are some other things you can do to help with development. You can check out the <a href="http://thespacecoder.com/myschool" target="_blank">Development Branch</a> and help search for bugs and test the app's stability (please understand that this branch is going to be unstable by nature and will not always be working, I break things a lot and this is where I test everything before the public sees it). If you are not adventurous enough to go into the development branch there is one more thing you can do. You can contact me if you run into any problems, have a question, or if you just want to tell me about your experience. So feel free to tweet me <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSpaceCoder" target="_blank">@TheSpaceCoder</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:contact@thespaceocoder.com">contact@thespacecoder.com</a>. I hope you have an enjoyable experience and find this app just as useful as Nick and I do.</p>
